This defines individual particle types (particletypes.conf):

particle {
	name             Name, used in editors, etc
	image            Sprite name
	directional      1 = particle sprite is influenced by direction, default = 0
	num_frames       Number of frames in animation
	lin_speed*       Initial speed
	lin_accel*       Acceleration of the speed, in pixels/second
	age*             The age of the particle
	damage*          Initial amount of damage the particle causes upon impact
	damage_accel*    Acceleration of the damage amount, in hp/second
}

The * values support an (optional) range in the format {min, max}, where a random value is chosen
between those values.

The accel options would normally be specified as negative values, but can still be positive if desired...

Hit points for units are a number between 10,000 and 0, with 0 being death.

Filenames are "<image>/<angle>deg_fr<frame>.bmp", where
   <image> is the image name specified in the particle config
   <angle> is the angle number, 0 - 270 in increments of 45 for directional, 0 for non-directional
   <frame> is the zero-based frame number, upto num_frames - 1


This defines available particle generators (particlegenerators.conf):

Each generator can spew out with multiple particle types

generator {
	name             Name, used in editors, etc
	
	spew {
		name             Name, used in editors, etc
		type             The particle ID, 0-based index based on the order of the 'particle' sections
		angle_range      Range of angles to spew from
		rate             Number to spew per second
		time             How much time the spewing has
		offset           The distance, in pixels, to offset the particle from the generator
	}
	
	spew {
		...
	}
}
