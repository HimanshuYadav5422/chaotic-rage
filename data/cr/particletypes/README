This defines individual particle types (particletypes.conf):

particle {
	name             Name, used in editors, etc
	image            Sprite name
	directional      1 = particle sprite is influenced by direction, default = 0
	num_frames       Number of frames in animation
	lin_speed        Initial speed
	lin_accel        Initial acceleration
	age              The age of the particle
}

Filenames are "<image>/<angle>deg_fr<frame>.bmp", where
   <image> is the image name specified in the particle config
   <angle> is the angle number, 0 - 270 in increments of 45 for directional, 0 for non-directional
   <frame> is the zero-based frame number, upto num_frames - 1


This defines available particle generators (particlegenerators.conf):

Each generator can spew out with multiple particle types

generator {
	name             Name, used in editors, etc
	
	spew {
		name             Name, used in editors, etc
		type             The particle ID, 0-based index based on the order of the 'particle' sections
		angle_range      Range of angles to spew from
		rate             Number to spew per second
		time             How much time the spewing has
	}
	
	spew {
		...
	}
}
