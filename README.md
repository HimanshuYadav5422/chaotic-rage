Making mods
-----------

The game is designed with extensability in mind. All of game data
is abstracted into data modules, and multiple mods can be loaded at once.

The mods contain the definitions for everything in the game,
as well as 3D models, sounds, songs, etc. The game also uses the scripting
language Lua, which provides logic for AIs, as well as managed game types.
