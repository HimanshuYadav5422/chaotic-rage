This base mesh is my current "rinse and repeat" when it comes for almost all of my humanoids.
I am not claiming it to be perfect by any standard, but with a little TLC given to the joints,
you can easily animate it. (I added a few extra edge loops to make it easier as well).

With this, you can easily create any humanoid character you want.

Also, you may find a lot of unnecessary loop cuts. All of the ones that seem superfluous are
for my personal use, so you can easily remove them.

It's not perfect by any means, but it's definitely a good jumping-off point for beginning
modelers / developers on a budget :D

Attribution Instructions:
Nada. Zilch. Take it, use it, love it (or try at least) I made this as a test to see if
I could when I started modeling, and... I could.
