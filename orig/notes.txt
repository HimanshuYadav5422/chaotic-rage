There is a tool called "copyorig.sh", which will copy all .obj and .png files into dara/cr/animmodels

It will exclude files containing "uv" or "render".

You should probably:
 - Name everything the same (e.g. war_fence.blend, war_fence.obj, war_fence.png)
 - Keep a copy of the texture in layered (with overlay as a layer) e.g. war_fence.xcf
 - Don't commit .blend1 or .blend2s
