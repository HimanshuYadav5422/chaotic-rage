When thinking of milestones, think of points in time where the game can be released as-is.

While these theoretical releases would probably be quite poor, all of the release targets
are at the same level as each other - it would be quite bad to have perfect gameplay, but
lame graphics for example.

Chaotic Rage has the following targets:
 - Models & Textures
 - Animations
 - Sound
 - Game engine features
 - Game logic
 - Map & datafile editors
 - Engine configuration

This brings us to the milestones.

Milestone #5: Due Sat 25 June:
 - By this stage it should be looking fairly good
   It's a little difficult to judge how long various
   tasks are going to take.
   There are some things not on this list, but would
   be good to do - and some which may be ditched.
