unitclass.conf defines everything about the unit classes.

Each class defines some base settings, and a group of settings which get applied depending on the modifiers present

Each class has its own directory for sprites. Sprite filename is <class_name>/<state_name>_<angle>deg_fr<frame>.bmp
 - <state_name> is the name of the state, as defined in the config file
 - <angle> is the angle, in degrees. Values = 0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, 315.
 - <frame> is the 0-based frame number for the sprite.

Multiple states can be defined for each state type

State types:
0 = walking
1 = static
2 = running
3 = firing

The walking state sprite will be ADDED to the other sprite (drawn below it)
