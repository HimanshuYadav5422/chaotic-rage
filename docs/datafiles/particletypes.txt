This defines individual particle types (particletypes.conf):

particle {
	name             Name, used in editors, etc
	model            3D model to use
	begin_speed*     Initial speed
	max_speed*       Maximum speed
	accel*           Acceleration of the speed, in pixels/second
	age*             The age of the particle, milliseconds
	unit_damage*     Damage the particle causes against a unit
	wall_damage*     Damage the particle causes against a wall
	unit_hits*       Number of hits the particle takes before it is removed (unit)
	wall_hits*       Number of hits the particle takes before it is removed (wall)
}

The * values support an (optional) range in the format {min, max}, where a random value is chosen
between those values.

The accel options would normally be specified as negative values, but can still be positive if desired...

Unit hit points for units are a number between 10,000 and 0, with 0 being death.


This defines available particle generators (particlegenerators.conf):

Each generator can spew out with multiple particle types

generator {
	name             Name, used in editors, etc
	
	spew {
		name             Name, used in editors, etc
		type             The particle ID, 0-based index based on the order of the 'particle' sections
		angle_range      Range of angles to spew from
		rate             Number to spew per second
		time             How much time the spewing has
		offset           The distance, in pixels, to offset the particle from the generator
	}
	
	spew {
		...
	}
}
