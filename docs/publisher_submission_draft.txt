Hi and welcome to Chaotic Rage!

Chaotic Rage is a 2D top-view shooter game. It is multiplayer only, allowing for a more
focused approach to the game development. It has simple, yet effective graphics. It
runs on multiple platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux), and players from different platforms
can co-exist in the same game.

This is a game which was birthed from of a vision of more immersive multiplayer
games than what is currently available. A few games, both PC and console, come
close to what we are hoping for, but we feel that this is an area which can be improved
upon, and that adding flashier graphics won't do the trick. In fact, we believe that
it can be acheived even with simple graphics.

The game is inspired by older 2D shooter games such as the DOS classic Liero, and a more recent
freeware title, Soldat. Inspiration also comes from the popular game Team Fortress 2.
These games have a fast-paced style which we like. Inspiration also comes from the games from
the Worms series. We appreciate the lack of seriousness which these games have, as well as
the broad range of weapons available in these games.

Fully destructable environments.

Multiple unit types

Numerous weapons

Heaps of gametypes, unique gametype elements

Map builder, mod builder
