You will need at least these:
 - A compiler. The makefiles are written for GCC
 - SDL 1.2
 - SDL_Mixer 1.2
 - SDL_Image 1.2
 - SDL_Net 1.2
 - zziplib
 - libconfuse
 - gl
 - glu
 - glew
 - Lua
 - Freetype2
 - Bullet Physics (and cmake if building yourself)
 - Guichan


Compiling on Ubuntu 10.04:
 1. Install dependencies:
     - g++
     - make
     - cmake
     - flex
     - libsdl1.2-dev
     - libsdl-image1.2-dev
     - libsdl-mixer1.2-dev
     - libsdl-net1.2-dev
     - libzzip-dev
     - libconfuse-dev
     - libgl1-mesa-dev
     - libglu1-mesa-dev
     - libglew-dev
     - liblua5.1-0-dev
     - libfreetype6-dev
     - libguichan-dev
    You can also use this command:
     sudo apt-get install g++ make cmake flex libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev \
     libsdl-net1.2-dev libzzip-dev libconfuse-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libglew-dev \
     liblua5.1-0-dev libfreetype6-dev libguichan-dev

 2. Compile bullet from lib-external
    This will install bullet also

 3. Compile using make


Compiling on Windows:
 1. Download and install MSVC 2010 Express Edition.
    I haven't tested full edition.

 2. Open the solution in the extra/msvc2010 directory
 
 3. It should compile out-of-the-box, no further setup
    should be nessasary.
