You will need at least these:
 - A compiler. GCC has been tested. clang should work but hasn't been tested
 - SDL 2.0.1
 - SDL_Mixer 2.0
 - SDL_Image 2.0
 - SDL_Net 2.0
 - zziplib
 - libconfuse
 - gl
 - glu
 - glew
 - Lua
 - Freetype2
 - Bullet Physics
 - Assimp

Scripts for downloading and building Bullet, Assimp and SDL2 are available in the
tools/linux directory if your distribution does not support them.


Compiling on Ubuntu 10.04:
 1. Install dependencies:
     - g++
     - make
     - cmake
     - flex
     - libzzip-dev
     - libconfuse-dev
     - libgl1-mesa-dev
     - libglu1-mesa-dev
     - libglew-dev
     - liblua5.1-0-dev
     - libfreetype6-dev
    You can also use this command:
     sudo apt-get install g++ make cmake flex libzzip-dev libconfuse-dev libgl1-mesa-dev \
     libglu1-mesa-dev libglew-dev liblua5.1-0-dev libfreetype6-dev libguichan-dev

 2. Compile libs in tools/linux
    The compile will do an install using sudo, you'll need your password
    
 3. Compile using make


Compiling on Windows:
 1. Download and install MSVC 2010 Express Edition.
    I haven't tested full edition.

 2. Open the solution in the tools/msvc2010 directory
 
 3. It should compile out-of-the-box, no further setup
    should be nessasary.
