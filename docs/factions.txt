There are a number of factions in the game

The faction rules are used to determine which zones are active for
which players.


FACTION_TEAM1 - FACTION_TEAM8
	Regular game teams.
	When playing a team game these are used

FACTION_INDIVIDUAL
	Used when playing a non-team game

FACTION_COMMON
	Some team games involve a common goal - such as a single
	flag which should spawn in the middle of the map.
	This is different to tying the zone to all of the teams
	because the zone will only be activated if playing a game
	which uses common goals.
